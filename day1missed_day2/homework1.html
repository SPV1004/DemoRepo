    <h1>My Favorite Things</h1>
    <p>I’ve always been passionate about cars, everything from their engineering to the joy of driving. That interest naturally led me to RC cars and drones, where I can combine my love for technology with hands-on fun. Tuning, flying, and experimenting with them gives me a creative outlet and a chance to unwind.</p>
